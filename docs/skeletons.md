# Project skeletons

Project skeletons are blueprints that can be used to create new projects. They
can be fully templated and composed, or inherit from other skeletons.

This section provides documentation for creating, customizing and using project
skeletons.

The most basic commands for interacting with them are listed below without much
explanation. Navigate to the subpages for more details.

### Skeleton creation

```bash
$ kickoff skeleton create ~/kickoff-skeletons/skeletons/myskeleton
```

### Listing skeletons

```bash
$ kickoff skeleton list
```

### Inspecting skeletons

```bash
$ kickoff skeleton show myskeleton
```
